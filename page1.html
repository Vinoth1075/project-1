        <h1>BMW</h1>
        <P>The official founding date of the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW is 7 March 1916, when an aircraft producer called Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik) was established.[1][2] This company was renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the BMW name dates back to 1917, when Rapp Motorenwerke changed its name to Bayerische Motoren Werke.[3] BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes.</P>
        <p>BMW's first automotive straight-six engine was released in 1933,[34][35] in the BMW 303, which was larger and more conventional than its 3/20 predecessor.[36][34] The 303 was also the first BMW to use the "kidney grille" that would become a characteristic of BMW styling.[37] The 303 formed the basis for the four-cylinder 309 and the larger-engined 315 and 319,[38][39] while the 315/1 and 319/1 roadsters were built using the chassis of the 303.[38][40] and the restyled 329.[</p>
        <p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly abbreviated to BMW, is a German multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. Wikipedia
